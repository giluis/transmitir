# What's this?
A small web page designed show a morse code message to a loved one.
The message is hardcoded in [app.js](./app.js) in the global var `message`.

# TODO
1- Have a `create` functionality that allows creating a message and sending the link to a loved one
2- Simplify the animation code
3- Use a more pleasant sound for the morse signals
