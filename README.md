# What's this?
A small web page designed show a morse code message to a loved one.  
You can use it [here](https://giluis.github.io/transmitir){target = "_blank"}  
The message is hardcoded in [app.js](./app.js) in the global var `message`.  

# TODO
- [ ] Have a `create` page that allows creating a message and sending the link to the transmission to a loved one
- [ ] Simplify the animation code
- [ ] Use a more pleasant sound for the morse signals
